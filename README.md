# chess-stockfish
## Setup:

Download <a href="https://stockfishchess.org/download/">stockfish</a> and place all the files from github to that downloaded folder.
You should have main.py and stockfish.exe in the same directory. <br>
<br>
To run it you need <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python</a> and then install requiments from .txt using <code>pip -r requiments.txt</code> or start up setup.bat.<br>
OR u can just use the main.exe from <a href="https://github.com/XAP3xOnTop/chess-stockfish/releases">releases</a> so u dont have to install pyhon (place the main.exe into directory with stockfish.exe).
